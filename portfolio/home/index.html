        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am a Release Coordinator and part time student at Curtin University. I have experience in deliverying financial projects and have adopted technical skills via Curtin and on the job training. I am well versed 
          in agile ways of working and tools such as the Atlassian suite. I am hoping to complement my experience with the completion of a Bachelor of Commerce -  Business Information Technology and Systems Double Major. 
        </p>
        <br>
        </p>I began my career as a payroll officer assistant moving through various roles that led me to project management work. Overseas I extended my knowledge as I supported the teams to deliver 
        country wide projects in Seychelles. Returning to Australia with my wife and children I endeavoured to further my knowledge and formalise my skill set into a degree which led me to multiple 
      opportunities in the IT industry. I wish to continue my work and career with my current emloyer however explore possibilities in consulting and business process improvement. </p>
