            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is an HTML document that structures a webpage with a header, three sections, and a footer. 
              It discusses web design, content, and technologies used. The document references an external CSS file that sets the 
              layout, spacing, and background color of the page, and includes comments on design strategies and color theory.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>This code uses HTML and CSS to structure and style a basic web page. HTML5 semantic tags and links to external CSS are used to give meaning and apply styles to specific HTML elements. 
              CSS properties and relative units are used to change the appearance and layout of the page, with comments providing guidance on web page design.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The technologies used to create this web page are HTML5 and CSS3. HTML5 is used for structuring the content of the page, while CSS3 is used for styling the content 
              and layout of the page. The HTML code provides the basic structure of the page, including the header, sections, and footer, while the CSS code provides the visual design elements, such as the font styles, colors, and layout.
              Additionally, the web page includes images that are linked to external sources, and it uses a Creative Commons license for copyright purposes.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This code defines a web page with clickable circles representing rock, paper, and scissors and a link to the game rules. The JavaScript file contains two functions: say, which converts a message into synthesized speech using the SpeechSynthesis API, and play, which is a simplified version of the game that determines the user's win, loss, or tie with the computer (which always chooses rock), displays an alert message, and calls the say function to read the message aloud. The CSS rules define the visual style of the page, including the appearance of the circles and link. 
              Overall, this code allows users to play a simplified version of the game and hear the result spoken aloud.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>This code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web page that implements a simplified version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, with the computer always choosing rock. It also includes a text-to-speech function to announce the game result. 
              The code uses standard web development techniques to structure the page, style the content, and add interactivity.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The technologies used in this code are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              The HTML code defines the structure of the web page and contains links to the CSS and JavaScript files. The CSS code sets the style and appearance of the elements on the page, such as the circles and the instruction text. The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the page, such as responding to user clicks on the circles and generating alerts with the result of the game. Additionally, the JavaScript code also uses the Web Speech API to generate text-to-speech output of the game result.</p>

          </section>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This project involves an interactive web page called "Flatland" that enables users to explore a two-dimensional world and engage with its inhabitants. 
              When the user clicks on the central red square, the right-hand text box displays a message containing a randomly generated buzzword phrase. Hovering over the square changes its background color to grey, which changes back to red when the cursor moves away.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>The webpage is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, including the title, author, and content. The CSS file defines the styling of the webpage, including the font, size, and layout. The JavaScript file provides the interactivity of the webpage, including the ability to generate a random buzzword phrase and change the color of the square.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The project uses HTML for creating the structure and content of the webpage, including the placement of elements and their attributes, CSS for styling the webpage with colors, fonts, 
              and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity such as generating buzzword phrases or changing the color of the square. Some specific techniques used in the code include accessing 
              and modifying HTML elements with document.getElementById() in JavaScript, registering event listeners for user actions with addEventListener(), generating random values with Math.floor() and Math.random(), and applying styles to specific HTML elements with CSS rules.</p>

          </a>
          <section id="info-rss" style="display:none;">
            
          </section>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The code is a simple HTML webpage with a form for the user to input an RSS feed URL and a main section where the results will be displayed. The JavaScript code defines a function to add RSS feed data to the webpage, creates an XMLHttpRequest object to fetch the data, and sets up an event listener for the form submit button to handle the user input and initiate the XMLHttpRequest. If successful, the data is parsed as JSON and the addRSStoDOM function is called with the resulting data.
              If the request fails, an error message is displayed.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>This code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to create an RSS Reader web application. HTML is used to structure the web page, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript is used to dynamically add content to the web page, handle events, and fetch data from external sources using AJAX (XMLHttpRequest). 
              The web page is designed to be responsive, with a navigation bar, content section, and footer. The code also implements a function to create HTML elements dynamically and insert them into the DOM, which is a common technique used in web development.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>This code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage. The HTML sets up the webpage's structure and form for entering an RSS feed URL, while the CSS defines its style. The JavaScript handles user interactions and uses XMLHttpRequest to retrieve and parse RSS feed data as JSON. It then adds the articles to the webpage using DOM manipulation.</p>

          </section>      
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The code is for a todo list application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks based on their status. The application saves the current state of each task in local storage so that it can be restored upon reloading the page. The code includes event listeners, functions to handle those events, and some simple styling rules. 
              The list item element is defined in a script tag.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>The code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a to-do list application that enables users to add, remove, and filter tasks. HTML provides the page structure and content, CSS adds style to the elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity by 
              handling user input and storing data in the browser's local storage.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web page with dynamic behavior. HTML is used to structure the content of the page, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to handle user input, manipulate the HTML and CSS elements, and save data to local storage. The page includes a header, body, form, and
              unordered list elements, and the CSS defines the styling attributes such as font size, width, and margin.</p>
