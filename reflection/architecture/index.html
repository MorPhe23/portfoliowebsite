        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        Some of the key components of information architecture include:
          <ol>
            <li>Navigation: the way users move through the information, including menus, links, and buttons.</li>
            <li>Taxonomy: the organization of information into categories, subcategories, and labels.</li>
            <li>Search: the functionality that allows users to search for specific information.</li>
            <li>Labeling: the words and phrases used to describe and categorize information.</li>
            <li>Structure: the overall organization and hierarchy of the information.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>The code represents a single-page site's information architecture with three main sections enclosed in divs with a class of 'column': 
        Work experience, Education and skills, and Interests. The top section comprises a navigation bar with a class of 'hero-image', and 
        the div with navigation links has a class of 'hero-text'.For website information architecture, the organization and presentation of 
        information on a website include the website's structure, content labeling, navigation system, and user experience. </p> 
        
        <p> The HTML code's "head" 
          section contains metadata such as title, author, and keywords, while the "body" section has the main content. The code uses semantic HTML 
            tags such as "section", "nav", "h1", "h3", "p", "a", and "img" to structure the content, while CSS rules define the visual style of the page. 
      The information architecture is well-organized with clear headings and descriptions and easy to navigate.</p>

        <br>

        <p></p>

        <h2>Java Script Architecture </h2>
        <p>The information architecture in this code is related to the organization and structure of the functions and variables used to create a text-to-speech
        functionality. The code defines a function called splitTextIntoChunks that takes a string of text and divides it into smaller chunks based on
          a maximum length. It also defines a function called speakChunksSequentially that takes an array of text chunks and speaks them one by one,
          using the SpeechSynthesisUtterance API.</p>
      
      
        <p>The main function in the code is an event listener attached to a button, which toggles between starting and stopping the text-to-speech functionality. 
        It checks if the SpeechSynthesis API is available, and if so, it gets the first available voice and binds it to the utterance object. It then splits 
        the page text into chunks using splitTextIntoChunks and speaks them sequentially using speakChunksSequentially.
        Overall, the code uses a clear and logical organization of functions and variables to implement the text-to-speech functionality in a way that is
        easy to understand and modify.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Document Object Model (DOM) </h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface used to structure HTML and XML documents. It allows JavaScript to access HTML elements on a web page. 
          HTML tags define relationships between different elements, with some being superordinate or subordinate to others. 
          The DOM uses a tree structure to arrange these elements and display their hierarchies. When binding an event to a DOM element, the event handler can be included in the DOM element
          referenced in the event attribute (Reference https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/an-introduction-to-the-document-object-model-dom/).

        <h2>CSS Architecture</h2>
        <p>The code snippet contains Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules that define the styling for a web page. Information architecture (IA) is not explicitly present in the code, but it is indirectly implied through the structure and layout of the page.
        The code defines the layout of the page using a header, three columns, and a footer. The columns and header are divided into different sections, such as a hero image with a text overlay, a navigation bar, and text content. This layout helps organize the
        information into distinct sections, which makes it easier for users to navigate the page and find the information they are looking for.</p>
      
        <p>TThe CSS also defines the style of the text, such as font size, color, and alignment, which helps to improve the readability and accessibility of the content. Additionally, the CSS defines a responsive layout for smaller screens, which ensures that the page remains usable and accessible on different devices.
        Overall, the IA for this code can be inferred from the layout and structure of the page, as well as the CSS rules that define the visual style and layout of the content.</p>
        
        
        <br>

        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>The code is a HTML code for a web page that displays information about a person's work experience, education, skills, and interests.
        As such, it does not have a "system architecture" in the traditional sense of software design. However, we can talk about the general architecture 
        of the web page. The architecture of this web page is based on the client-server model, where the client (i.e., the user's web browser) requests 
        a page from the server (i.e., the web server hosting the HTML file) and displays it to the user. The HTML file contains the content to be displayed,
        while the web server handles the requests and serves the appropriate file.</p>

        <p>The page is organized using the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a hierarchical representation of the HTML elements in the page.
        The CSS stylesheet is used to style the page's elements and layout, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page, such as the "Click to speak" button.
        Overall, the architecture of this web page is relatively simple and follows standard web development practices.</p>

        <p>This code represents a basic HTML web page that contains both structural and presentational elements. It consists of a head section where meta tags, title, 
        and external CSS file are declared. The body section contains two main elements: a section with a hero image and a text overlay containing navigation links, 
        and a contact form that enables the user to submit data to the website owner.
        The architecture of the system cannot be determined from the provided code alone as it is only a front-end implementation. The back-end and database
        implementation (if any) of the system are not included in the code snippet.</p>


        <p>In terms of system architecture, the code is designed to run on a web browser, which interprets and renders the HTML document, applies the CSS styles, and executes the JavaScript code. It is based on a client-server architecture, where the client (web browser) requests and receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a server over the internet.
        The HTML code defines the structure of the webpage using elements such as "section", "div", "h1", "p", and "nav". 
        The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the webpage, such as the background color, font size, and spacing between elements.
        The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the webpage, such as allowing the user to click a button to hear text read aloud using the Web Speech API.</p>
