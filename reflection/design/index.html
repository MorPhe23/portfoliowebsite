        </a>
        
          <p>The about page is a summary of work experience, education, skills and interests. The initial MVP utilised the template from the projects page to enable two rows and three columns. 
            Later, enhancements were added to include two buttons to download a resum and a powerpoint pack that summarises my work experience. The text to speech feature is enabled on this page to read all sections.          </p>

            onmouseover="showInfo('contact');" onmouseout="hideInfo('contact');">
        </a>
       
          <p>The contact page follows similar styling as the other pages. A form takes up majority of the page to capture a users name, email and the inquiry. The MVP consisted of just a form however an enhancment was added
            to enable the submit button to trigger an email and summaries the form fields to send to my email address. A reset button was added to clear all contents.The text to speech feature is enabled on this page to read all sections.</p>

        <h3>Home Page Design</h3>
        
        <br>
        
        <img src="images/homedesign.jpg" alt="webdesign" style="width:100%; text-decoration:none;"
        onmouseover="showInfo('home');" onmouseout="hideInfo('home');">
        </a>
        

            <p>
              The home page was the first page created with a header image, menu and inspirational quote. The bottom half of the page consists of one row and three columns. A profile picture image is centered in the second column
              and links to social media are contained within. The home page became the template to rollout and ensure consistent design to the other pages. The text to speech feature is enabled on this page to read all sections.

               onmouseover="showInfo('project');" onmouseout="hideInfo('project');">
         
        </a>
       
          <p>The project page was designed aiming to have two rows three columns, images imbedded in the cells and text in each cell. Developing this page was complicated and resizing of the images needed
            to be done to ensure they all align. I made the decision to hide the text to display only on hover to improve the look and feel of the page.</p>

        </a>
        
          <p>The reflection page is a simlar design to the home page consisting of one row and three columns. The columns all contain text which became the MVP. Later, buttons were added to download the user stories
            and non conformance report as well as a link to the page designs.</p>
