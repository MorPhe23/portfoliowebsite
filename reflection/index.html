        <h2>Development of the portfolio website</h2>
        <p>To develop the portfolio website I initially researched some existing sites to get some ideas such as the following google search <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2Fpersonalportfolio-free-template.jpeg&tbnid=BUvPZiZUnMRxvM&vet=12ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp%2Ftemplate%2Fpersonalportfolio%2F&docid=6udPZgSpUXDxWM&w=1200&h=946&q=portfolio%20website&ved=2ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ.">(Inspiration)</a> 
          I brainstormed who might be potential viewers of the site to determine personas and worked through the following processes.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Determined features, user stories and tasks.</li>
              <li>Utilised MosCow to prioritise the stories </li>
              <li>Determined the requirements that would form the MVP</li>
              <li>Determined the information and system architecture </li>
              <li>Designed the pages that would form the MVP</li>
            </ol>
          <br>
          
        <p>I listed some hard features that would be needed in the website using the assignment brief as requirements. 
          This included, the mandatory pages and technologies to be used. 
          I created an initial list of user stories and associated tasks. 
          Following an Agile process I performed a MoScoW analysis to priortise the list of stories and determined the criteria and 
          list of stories that would form the minimum viable product (MVP). Using Powerpoint I created the wireframe designs for each page.</p>
        <p>During the class workshop we were given a demonstration of creating a page using a template from W3 Schools. I decided on a theme which would be pictures from my travels as headers and inspirational quotes. I utilized this template to build the first page being the project page and then proceeded to develop the first list of user stories that formed the MVP.
        Further enhancements were progressively added such as, click to speak and document download ability.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>Development was done locally using visual studio and utilizing a google chrome browser to open the HTML file. In the MVP and initial versions of the pages local links were used containing the C drive link in the path name which later created problems. Once I was satisfied with the first draft of my website including the pages I attempted to deploy to Netflify. At this stage my Github repository was set to private and I had not checked using Github as majority of the development work was done locally. The Netflify deployment resulted in success however when attempting to open the live site I was notified of a 404 error.
             I made several attempts which resulted in the same result.</p>
          <p>After some brainstorming I arrived to the conclusion that the issue was from the page links within the files. To test this theory I decided to set my Github repository to public and update the links. I referred to chat GPT for assistance which recommended utilizing relative paths. I updated the links removing the path to c drive and making them relative to the folder they are in. After deploying in Github dev it resulted in just a page that displayed portfolio website. From this image I realized that the issue was from the folder structure I had used to develop the sit locally. 
            All the folders including the home page and sub page sub folders were saved in a parent file titled portfolio website. </p>
          <p>To resolve this issue I had to do some restructuring and started by moving the home page index file, css file and java script file to the main directory and out of the parent folder. After deploying this resulted in the home page working in Git hub however the other pages now not working. 
            To resolve this second issue I updated every menu link in each of the nine pages to relative paths which resolved the issue on the home page.</p>
          <p>After testing the sub pages the next issue was none of the links on the sub pages were opening to other pages. This took much thought and recalling the advice from the unit workshop using ../ to instruct the program to look for a file up a level I was able to resolve the link to the home page on one of the sub pages. This issue was present on every page and I worked my way one page at a time. Some of the pages were sub pages contained in sub folders and I had to utilize ../../ to move up another level where this situation existed. 
            After deploying to github the issue was now resolved. </p>
          <p>The next issue that I worked on was that some of the page header images were not displaying. This again took some time to troubleshoot and page by page I worked through after identifying the issue was with the image link references in the code pointing to the wrong folder. In two cases the image reference was pointing to a parent folder and in one case I decided to move this entire page and folder up a level. 
            Another related issue was that some of the filenames were incorrect where jpg was in capitals JPG which resolved some of the page image display issues. </p>
          <p>After deploying to github I redeployed on netlify and the page worked correctly. I then tested the page display on my mobile and found that some menus were not displaying correctly whilst some text were overlapping headers. 
            After doing some research online and getting advice from chat GPT I found the line to add to each page to auto adjust to mobile devices. However the issue still persisted and I was unable to resolve.</p>
          <p>Whilst resolving some of these issues I had decided to leave some pages within sub folders without links to other pages due to the structure however I noticed that this was not a good user experience and decided to move the sub folders to main directory locations. 
            Once moved I updated all the links in the pages and tested each page one by one so that each page could be accessed from every page. </p>
          <p>I also faced a challenge with hover text not working on my project images in netlify and decided to make a change moving the project description text at the bottom of the images rather than to appear on hover.</p>

          <h3>Other Challenges</h3>
          <p>The development of this site brought about many challenges. Arriving at a layout that I could template and reuse for additional pages took time. Additionally, some pages required a different layout due to the 
            requirements of the page. I was able to overcome many of the challenges using W3 schools for assistance and chat GPT, however many of the issues I could not resolve and left to discuss in the non conformance report.
            Some of the challenges that I faced through the development of the portfolio website were:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Adding one row with three columns was easily achieved. However, adding a second row and getting the images on the projects page to fit was challening and took quite some time to resolve. Referring to W3 schools I was able
              to obtain the code to add another row. Through trial and error on the CSS style sheet I modified the image size of each image until they were the right sizing.
            </li>
            <li>In the initial versions of the site I came accross an issue where all project titles were underlined with some in blue and purple font except for the first. I was able to overcome this by updating the CSS file
              and by wrapping the image in an anchor tag. Using references from W3 schools I was able to obtain the code to add to the CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>Sending an email when the user clicks submit on the contact form was challening. Using chat GPT and W3 schools I was able to resolve with java script so the submit button sends an emmail with the contact form contents.</li>
            <li>Getting the text to appear when hovering over the images on the projects page was resolved however resulted in another issue.</li>
            <li>As mentioned the hover text issue was resolved however the bottom row images resulted in glitches when hidden text displayed from the hover action.</li>
            <li>Text to speech was cutting out after a few lines. This took some time and research and after referring to online help and chat GPT I applied a fix to break the speech into chunks 
              and adjust the maximum length per chunk.</li>
          </ol>

        <section>
        <h2>Successes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>To ensure that the website appears correctly on all devices I researched and found the viewport code needed to accomplish this. This was added to every page.</li>
          <li>Whilst resolving the send email issue from the contact form I saw the need for a reset button to clear the contents from the form. This was achieved by replicating the submit button and searching a reset function on chat GPT.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other successes that were achieved are summarised below:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click to speak feature was added for accessibility to hearing impaired users.</li>
            <li>Hyperlinks were added to the menu page so that each page can be accessed from any page.</li>
            <li>The contact form was created for user information to be captured and the send email feature was enabled to summarise the inquiry.</li>
            <li>CSS Styling was made consistent for all the pages</li>
            <li>Text justification was added to all CSS files for each page for text to display neatly.</li>
            <li>Font reduction was added to projects page for text to appear and fit when hover over image. Although, issues persisted with the glitching of text on the bottom row images.</li>
            <li>When clicking the speak button for text to speech the feature would not stop until all the words on the page are spoken. After asking for user feedback I added a stop feature on a seperate button and later
              merged into one button to stop and start.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
              
        <p>To complement the description of the process followed I decided to create additional pages to save the content used to design and develop the site.</p>
        <p> <a href="../reflection/architecture/index.html">Architecture Page</a></p>
        <p>The architecture page was created to document the thinking relating to the information, CSS, System, java script architecture and document object model. Designs have been included to illustrate the architecture with explanation given on how the technologies were organized for the build. </p>
        <p><a href="../reflection/design/index.html">Designs Page</a></p>
        <p>As mentioned, page designs were done using Powerpoint. In some pages I was able to reuse templates such as the home and reflection page as they had three column and one row. I was able to modify this template to add additional rows for other pages whilst some such as the contact form had to be researched and built. The design and development pages were not included in the initial page designs however the templates from other pages were reused to build them. </p>
        <p><a href="../reflection/stories/index.html">User Stories Page</a></p>
        <p>This page illustrates the journey for the stories as they were initially listed with sub tasks, prioritized through the MoScoW process then formed the MVP. Since I had available time I was able to delivery the majority of the stories in the website through further iterations of development which was later tested. </p>
