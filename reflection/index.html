      <h2>Development of the portfolio website</h2>
      <p>To develop the portfolio website I initially researched some existing sites to get some ideas such as the following google search <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2Fpersonalportfolio-free-template.jpeg&tbnid=BUvPZiZUnMRxvM&vet=12ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp%2Ftemplate%2Fpersonalportfolio%2F&docid=6udPZgSpUXDxWM&w=1200&h=946&q=portfolio%20website&ved=2ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ.">(Inspiration)</a> 
        I brainstormed who might be potential viewers of the site to determine personas and worked through the following processes.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Determined features, user stories and tasks.</li>
            <li>Utilised MosCow to prioritise the stories </li>
            <li>Determined the requirements that would form the MVP</li>
            <li>Determined the information and system architecture </li>
            <li>Designed the pages that would form the MVP</li>
          </ol>
        <br>
        
        <section>I listed some hard features that would be needed in the website using the assignment brief as requirements. 
          This included, the mandatory pages and technologies to be used. 
          I created an initial list of user stories and associated tasks. 
          Following an Agile process I performed a MoScoW analysis to priortise the list of stories and determined the criteria and 
          list of stories that would form the minimum viable product (MVP). Using Powerpoint I created the wireframe designs for each page.</p>
        <p>During the class workshop we were given a demonstration of creating a page using a template from W3 Schools. I decided on a theme which would be pictures from my travels as headers and inspirational quotes. I utilized this template to build the first page being the project page and then proceeded to develop the first list of user stories that formed the MVP.
        Further enhancements were progressively added such as, click to speak and document download ability.</section>

        <section>
          <h2>Additional Information</h2>
                
          <p>To complement the description of the process followed I decided to create additional pages to save the content used to design and develop the site.</p>
          <p> <a href="../reflection/architecture/index.html">Architecture Page</a></p>
          <p></p>The architecture page was created to document the thinking relating to the information, CSS, System, java script architecture and document object model. Designs have been included to illustrate the architecture with explanation given on how the technologies were organized for the build. </p>
          <p><a href="../reflection/design/index.html">Designs Page</a></p>
          <p>As mentioned, page designs were done using Powerpoint. In some pages I was able to reuse templates such as the home and reflection page as they had three column and one row. I was able to modify this template to add additional rows for other pages whilst some such as the contact form had to be researched and built. The design and development pages were not included in the initial page designs however the templates from other pages were reused to build them. </p>
          <p><a href="../reflection/stories/index.html">User Stories Page</a></p>
          <p>This page illustrates the journey for the stories as they were initially listed with sub tasks, prioritized through the MoScoW process then formed the MVP. Since I had available time I was able to delivery the majority of the stories in the website through further iterations of development which was later tested. </p>

            <p>Further information and features that were not implemented in the website are discussed in the Non conpliance report that can be downloaded below. <button id="non_conformance_report" onclick="window.open('images/non_conformance_report.docx', '_blank')">Download</button></p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The development of this site brought about many challenges. Arriving at a layout that I could template and reuse for additional pages took time. Additionally, some pages required a different layout due to the 
          requirements of the page. I was able to overcome many of the challenges using W3 schools for assistance and chat GPT, however many of the issues I could not resolve and left to discuss in the non conformance report.
          Some of the challenges that I faced through the development of the portfolio website were:
        </p>
        <li>Adding one row with three columns was easily achieved. However, adding a second row and getting the images on the projects page to fit was challening and took quite some time to resolve. Referring to W3 schools I was able
          to obtain the code to add another row. Through trial and error on the CSS style sheet I modified the image size of each image until they were the right sizing.
        </li>
        <li>In the initial versions of the site I came accross an issue where all project titles were underlined with some in blue and purple font except for the first. I was able to overcome this by updating the CSS file
          and by wrapping the image in an anchor tag. Using references from W3 schools I was able to obtain the code to add to the CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Sending an email when the user clicks submit on the contact form was challening. Using chat GPT and W3 schools I was able to resolve with java script so the submit button sends an emmail with the contact form contents.</li>
        <li>Getting the text to appear when hovering over the images on the projects page was resolved however resulted in another issue.</li>
        <li>As mentioned the hover text issue was resolved however the bottom row images resulted in glitches when hidden text displayed from the hover action.</li>
        <li>Text to speech was cutting out after a few lines. This took some time and research and after referring to online help and chat GPT I applied a fix to break the speech into chunks 
          and adjust the maximum length per chunk.</li>

      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <li>To ensure that the website appears correctly on all devices I researched and found the viewport code needed to accomplish this. This was added to every page.</li>
      <li>Whilst resolving the send email issue from the contact form I saw the need for a reset button to clear the contents from the form. This was achieved by replicating the submit button and searching a reset function on chat GPT.</li>
      <p>Other successes that were achieved are summarised below:</p>
        <li>Click to speak feature was added for accessibility to hearing impaired users.</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks were added to the menu page so that each page can be accessed from any page.</li>
        <li>The contact form was created for user information to be captured and the send email feature was enabled to summarise the inquiry.</li>
        <li>CSS Styling was made consistent for all the pages</li>
        <li>Text justification was added to all CSS files for each page for text to display neatly.</li>
        <li>Font reduction was added to projects page for text to appear and fit when hover over image. Although, issues persisted with the glitching of text on the bottom row images.</li>
        <li>When clicking the speak button for text to speech the feature would not stop until all the words on the page are spoken. After asking for user feedback I added a stop feature on a seperate button and later
          merged into one button to stop and start.</li>
