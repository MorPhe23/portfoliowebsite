      <h2>Development of the portfolio website</h2>
      <p>To develop the portfolio website I initially researched some existing sites to get some ideas such as the following google search <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2Fpersonalportfolio-free-template.jpeg&tbnid=BUvPZiZUnMRxvM&vet=12ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorlib.com%2Fwp%2Ftemplate%2Fpersonalportfolio%2F&docid=6udPZgSpUXDxWM&w=1200&h=946&q=portfolio%20website&ved=2ahUKEwjbgq6EzKD-AhVtyHMBHTw6DNMQMygLegUIARD7AQ.">(Inspiration)</a> 
        I brainstormed who might be potential viewers of the site to determine personas and worked through the following processes.
          <ol>
            <li>Determined features, user stories and tasks.</li>
            <li>Utilised MosCow to prioritise the stories </li>
            <li>Determined the requirements that would form the MVP</li>
            <li>Determined the information and system architecture </li>
            <li>Designed the pages that would form the MVP</li>
          </ol>
        <br>
        The detailed summary of the process followed is mentioned in the Non conformance report. <button id="non_conformance_report" onclick="window.open('images/non_conformance_report.docx', '_blank')">Download Non Conformance Report</button>

      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <li>To ensure that the website appears correctly on all devices I researched and found the viewport code needed to accomplish this. This was added to every page.</li>
      <li>Whilst resolving the send email issue from the contact form I saw the need for a reset button to clear the contents from the form. This was achieved by replicating the submit button and searching a reset function on chat GPT.</li>
      <p>Other successes that were achieved are summarised below:</p>
        <li>Click to speak feature was added for accessibility to hearing impaired users.</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks were added to the menu page so that each page can be accessed from any page.</li>
        <li>The contact form was created for user information to be captured and the send email feature was enabled to summarise the inquiry.</li>
        <li>CSS Styling was made consistent for all the pages</li>
        <li>Text justification was added to all CSS files for each page for text to display neatly.</li>
        <li>Font reduction was added to projects page for text to appear and fit when hover over image. Although, issues persisted with the glitching of text on the bottom row images.</li>
        <li>When clicking the speak button for text to speech the feature would not stop until all the words on the page are spoken. After asking for user feedback I added a stop feature on a seperate button and later
          merged into one button to stop and start.</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The development of this site brought about many challenges. Arriving at a layout that I could template and reuse for additional pages took time. Additionally, some pages required a different layout due to the 
          requirements of the page. I was able to overcome many of the challenges using W3 schools for assistance and chat GPT, however many of the issues I could not resolve and left to discuss in the non conformance report.
          Some of the challenges that I faced through the development of the portfolio website were:
        </p>
        <li>Adding one row with three columns was easily achieved. However, adding a second row and getting the images on the projects page to fit was challening and took quite some time to resolve. Referring to W3 schools I was able
          to obtain the code to add another row. Through trial and error on the CSS style sheet I modified the image size of each image until they were the right sizing.
        </li>
        <li>In the initial versions of the site I came accross an issue where all project titles were underlined with some in blue and purple font except for the first. I was able to overcome this by updating the CSS file
          and by wrapping the image in an anchor tag. Using references from W3 schools I was able to obtain the code to add to the CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Sending an email when the user clicks submit on the contact form was challening. Using chat GPT and W3 schools I was able to resolve with java script so the submit button sends an emmail with the contact form contents.</li>
        <li>Getting the text to appear when hovering over the images on the projects page was resolved however resulted in another issue.</li>
        <li>As mentioned the hover text issue was resolved however the bottom row images resulted in glitches when hidden text displayed from the hover action.</li>
        <li>Text to speech was cutting out after a few lines. This took some time and research and after referring to online help and chat GPT I applied a fix to break the speech into chunks 
          and adjust the maximum length per chunk.</li>
